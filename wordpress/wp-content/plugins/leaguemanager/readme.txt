== Installation ==

To install the plugin to the following steps

1. Unzip the zip-file and upload the content to your Wordpress Plugin directory.
2. Activiate the plugin via the admin plugin page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**I want to implement player registration. Is that possible?**

Yes it is, however not with this plugin, but with my [ProjectManager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/projectmanager/). It is designed to manage any recurrent datasets, such as player profiles. It is also possible to set a hook in the user profile. Any user with the capability *project_user_profile* is able to use this feature. You would also need the [Role Manager](http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/role-manager/) for access control. Further the plugin has a template engine implemented that makes it easy to design your own templates.


**How can I display the widget statically**

Put the following code where you want to display the widget

`<?php leaguemanager_display_widget( league_ID ); ?>`

Replace *league_ID* with the ID of the league you want to display. This will display the widget in a list with css class *leaguemanager_widget*.


== Screenshots ==
1. Main page for selected League
2. League Preferences
3. Adding of up to 15 matches simultaneously for one date
4. Easy insertion of tags via TinyMCE Button
5. Widget control panel


== Credits ==
The LeagueManager icon is taken from the Fugue Icons of http://www.pinvoke.com/.
