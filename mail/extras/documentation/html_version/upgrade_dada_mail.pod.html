<h1><a name="upgrading_dada_mail">Upgrading Dada Mail</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Before upgrading Dada Mail, find out how you installed and configured Dada Mail before. If you don't know or aren't sure, don't upgrade Dada Mail: you will run into major headaches.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="basic__or__contemporary__or_simple_scripts_">&quot;Basic&quot;, or, &quot;Contemporary&quot;? (Or Simple Scripts?)</a></h2>
<p>We're going to only differentiate between two types of installations: &quot;Basic&quot; and, &quot;Contemporary&quot; <em>(If you installed Dada Mail using the included installer, you have a <strong>Contemporary</strong> installation)</em></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="basic_installation">Basic Installation</a></h3>
<p>A, <strong>Basic</strong> installation changes the configuration variables right in the, <code>dada/DADA/Config.pm</code> file - usually you want to be very much aware of the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="_program_root_password" class="item">$PROGRAM_ROOT_PASSWORD</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="_files" class="item">$FILES</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="_mailprog" class="item">$MAILPROG</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="_program_url" class="item">$PROGRAM_URL</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>You'll know if you have a <strong>Basic</strong> installation of Dada Mail if the
 <a href="#_files"><code>$FILES</code></a> variable in the, <code>dada/DADA/Config.pm</code> file is  filled out to a directory that <em>actually</em> exists and that directory holds files/directories that have something to do with Dada Mail.</p>
<p>If you are running a <strong>Basic</strong> Installation of Dada Mail, we really suggest upgrading by taking note of where your <a href="#_files"><code>$FILES</code></a> variable is located and importing the old information <em>after</em> a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="more_information">More Information</a></h4>
<p><a href="basic_to_contemporary_installation.pod.html">basic_to_contemporary_installation.pod.html</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="contemporary_installation">Contemporary Installation</a></h3>
<p>A Contemporary Installation uses an outside configuration file to set the configuration variables in.</p>
<p>You'll know if you have a Contemporary Installation, if those same four variables in the, <code>dada/DADA/Config.pm</code> file:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$PROGRAM_ROOT_PASSWORD</strong>

<li><strong>$FILES</strong>

<li><strong>$MAILPROG</strong>

<li><strong>$PROGRAM_URL</strong>

</ul>
<p>Are still in their default values and your Dada Mail seems to be 
functioning fine. This probably means that your config variables are being read from an outside config file.</p>
<p>For upgrade purposes, note what the, <code>$PROGRAM_CONFIG_FILE_DIR</code> in the, <code>dada/DADA/Config.pm</code> is set to. It's OK if it's only set to, <code>auto</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="simple_scripts_installation">Simple Scripts Installation</a></h3>
<p>If you installed Dada Mail through Simple Scripts (<a href="http://simplescripts.com">http://simplescripts.com</a>) you have two good choices when it comes to upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="upgrade_through_simple_scripts">Upgrade Through Simple Scripts</a></h4>
<p>Upgrade a Simple Scripts installed Dada Mail through Simple Scripts on interface (look for an &quot;Upgrade&quot; link, or Simple Scripts may alert you of updates).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="turn_a_simple_scripts_install_into_a_contemporary_installation">Turn a Simple Scripts Install into a Contemporary Installation</a></h4>
<p>If you want to use the included Dada Mail installer to upgrade Dada Mail (perhaps, you purchased Pro Dada?), you can turn a Simple Scripts install into a Contemporary Installation with these directions:</p>
<p><a href="http://dadamailproject.com/d/upgrade_from_simple_scripts.pod.html">http://dadamailproject.com/d/upgrade_from_simple_scripts.pod.html</a></p>
<p>

<h1><a name="step__1_move_the_old_program_files_out_of_the_way">Step #1 Move The Old Program Files Out of the Way</a></h1>
<p>Dada Mail, &quot;The Program&quot; is the collection of files and directories that are in the directory called, <code>dada</code>.</p>
<p>If you've followed our installation instructions, this directory is most likely located in your <em>cgi-bin</em>. It's directory structure like this:</p>
<pre>
 cgi-bin (directory)
    - dada (directory, _lower_ case)
        - mail.cgi 
        - DADA (directory, UPPER case)
            - App (directory)
            - Config.pm
            - etc, etc, etc</pre>
<p>This is Dada Mail, <strong>&quot;The Program&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Simply rename this directory on your hosting account from:</p>
<pre>
 dada</pre>
<p>to something like:</p>
<pre>
 dada-old_ver</pre>
<p>Moving the directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="keeps_a_backup_that_is_known_to_work" class="item">Keeps a backup that is known to work</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="makes_sure_we_don_t_overwrite_the_old_version_of_the_program_with_the_new_version" class="item">Makes sure we don't overwrite the old version of the program with the new version</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="makes_sure_we_don_t_mix_up_the_old_version_of_dada_mail_with_the_new_version_of_dada_mail" class="item">Makes sure we don't mix up the old version of Dada Mail with the new version of Dada Mail</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step__2_install_the_new_dada_mail">Step #2 Install the new Dada Mail</a></h2>
<p>Now, you can just follow the instructions for an installation of Dada Mail:</p>
<p><a href="install_dada_mail.pod.html">install_dada_mail.pod.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="if_your_last_installation_was_a_contemporary_installation_use_the_same_value_as_before_for_your_dada_files_location" class="item">If your last installation was a Contemporary Installation, use the same value as before for your <code>.dada_files</code> location.</a></strong>

<p>Your Dada Files Location is usually the directory above your <code>PROGRAM_CONFIG_FILE_DIR</code> variable. For example, if my <code>PROGRAM_CONFIG_FILE_DIR</code> is set to:</p>
<p><em>/home/myaccount/.dada_files/.configs</em></p>
<p>my <code>.dada_files</code> directory is:</p>
<p><em>/home/myaccount/.dada_files</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="if_your_last_installation_was_a_basic_installation_install_dada_mail_as_if_it_s_a_brand_new_installation_and_then_move_your_old_list_settings_archives_etc_files_over" class="item">If your last installation was a Basic Installation, install Dada Mail as if it's a brand new installation and then move your old list/settings/archives/etc files over:</a></strong>

<p><a href="basic_to_contemporary_installation.pod.html">basic_to_contemporary_installation.pod.html</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the installer, type in the current location of your, <code>.dada_files</code> directory. The installer may also see that it's &quot;best guess&quot; is
already the current location of your <code>.dada_files</code> directory. It'll warn you about this, just in case it is not your intention to upgrade Dada Mail using that specific <code>.dada_files</code> directory. This is probably only an issue if you have multiple copies of Dada Mail installed.</p>
<p>Fill out the form fields of the installer, just like you were doing a installation. Click the, &quot;Configure Dada Mail!&quot; button.</p>
<p>When the screen refreshes, you'll see the same <strong>same configuration form</strong>, <em>but</em> with <strong>two new options</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading an installation with a MySQL backend, you'll also get a warning about your SQL databases already having tables that exist. Don't worry - that's a good thing! Just make sure to check the checkbox that says, <strong>I know these tables already exist.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="first_option__use_the_existing_directory_structure__but_create_a_new_configuration_file__using_the_configuration_below">First Option: Use the existing directory structure, but create a new configuration file, using the configuration below</a></h4>
<p>The first option, <em>Use the existing directory structure, but create a new configuration file, using the configuration below</em> allows you to upgrade your current Dada Mail, while using a <em>fresh</em> copy of the <code>.dada_config</code> file.</p>
<p>This option may be useful in helping you keep a current <code>.dada_config</code> file. In many cases, upgrades to Dada Mail between minor dot releases (for example, v4.<strong>5</strong>.0 and v4.<strong>6</strong>.0 come with changes to the default <code>.dada_config</code> file. These changes may include incompatibilities if you use your current <code>.dada_config</code> file.</p>
<p>You may not want to use this option if you've made custom changes to your <code>.dada_config</code> file that you do not want to lose. You still may manually move over your customizations from your old <code>.dada_config</code> file (which is backed up for you) to the new <code>.dada_config</code> file that will be generated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="second_option__use_the_existing_directory_structure_and_configuration_file__ignoring_the_configuration_below_">Second Option: Use the existing directory structure and configuration file, ignoring the configuration below.</a></h4>
<p>The second option, <em>Use the existing directory structure and configuration file, ignoring the configuration below.</em> will leave your Dada Mail configuration alone, and simply allow you to upgrade to the latest version of Dada Mail.</p>
<p>If you have any plugins/extensions that you've installed with the installer from a previous installation, the installer will <em>try</em> its best to at least change the permissions of each plugin/extension you have already installed to continue working. It's possible that the installer <em>cannot</em> detect a plugin/extension install, so you may have to reinstall the plugin/extension manually.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changelog">Changelog</a></h2>
<p>It's a <strong><em>very very</em></strong> good idea to look at the changelog and not <strong>any</strong> incompatibilities between versions. It's possible that incompatibilities could break your installation, when you upgrade.</p>
